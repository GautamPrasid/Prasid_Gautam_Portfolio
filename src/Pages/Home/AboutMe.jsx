            Namaste! I’m Prasid Gautam.

            Growing up in the serene landscapes of Pokhara, Nepal, I’ve always been a curious soul. At 18, that curiosity has led me into the world of university and the endless possibilities of software development. For me, coding is like cooking—it’s about taking the right ingredients, experimenting with flavors (or logic!), and creating something that people truly enjoy.

            When I’m not deep-diving into a new repository or troubleshooting code, you’ll find me in the kitchen trying to master a complex recipe or lost in the rhythm of my favorite playlist. I’m also a big believer in the 'classroom of the world.' Traveling isn't just a hobby for me; it’s how I recharge and find fresh perspectives that I bring back to my technical projects. I’m always looking for the next big challenge—whether it’s a bug to fix, a mountain to trek, or a new culture to explore.
